**HackAddis project wiki page**

During our years of development, we have met a lot of developers with specific skill sets and project ideas lacking input on part of the project domain. Great developers were not finding the great UI designers or great business developer or great project managers and so on.

Few developers have been discussing the possibility of having a collaborative community that can make great products and hence, Project HackAddis is born. This project aims at creating teams of developers and the like to come together and make things happen. We have defined sets of domains / project ideas / that teams can work on and also shared the skill set needed to get the job done.
