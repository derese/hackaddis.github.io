HackAddis project wiki page

During our years of development, we have met a lot of developers with specific skill sets and project ideas lacking input on part of the project domain. Great developers were not finding the great UI designers or great business developer or great project managers and so on.

Few developers have been discussing the possibility of having a collaborative community that can make great products and hence, Project HackAddis is born. This project aims at creating teams of developers and the like to come together and make things happen. We have defined sets of domains / project ideas / that teams can work on and also shared the skill set needed to get the job done.

The goal of this project is
	1 - provide a collaborative environment for the great minds of Addis
2 - to drive and produce high quality software products, enough to bring market and attention to Ethiopia

For a project to be complete, participating members will have to be sure of the time they can give to the projects and also make sure they have the right skill set.

For developers that want to be involved but donâ€™t think they have a skill set that can deliver at the time needed can apply to the project and shadow the team members by filling the attached shadow developer form.

Team members will be linked to a shadow member that will follow up and learn from them.

An example scenario is, If a team member is a project manager, and there is someone out there that wants to learn how to become a pm, s/he will shadow the pm and learn about the process

Management
Lead Developer/Project manager is responsible for making the project work. S/He will be tracking the project using industry standard tools provided.

Team HackAddis will be overlooking every project and will be giving assistance to any of the teams in any way needed.

We will be using industry standard methodologies and tools to get results. You will find the details of the project in the attached document.

How it works

Teams are composed of defined set of individuals depending on the project requirement. Team creation is done based on skill sets and applications.

By looking at project definitions and skill sets required, you can apply for a specific position in the team. For example most teams will have the following positions. Project Manager / Developer , UI/UX designer, business developer. If you see yourself fit in the positions required for the project you simply apply.
