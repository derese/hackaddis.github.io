<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h3>

<p>During our years of development, we have met a lot of developers with specific skill sets and project ideas lacking input on part of the project domain. Great developers were not finding the great UI designers or great business developer or great project managers and so on.</p>

<p>Few developers have been discussing the possibility of having a collaborative community that can make great products and hence, Project HackAddis is born. This project aims at creating teams of developers and the like to come together and make things happen. We have defined sets of domains / project ideas / that teams can work on and also shared the skillset needed to get the job done.</p>

<p>The goal of this project is:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Provide a collaborative environment for the great minds of addis</li>
	<li>To drive and produce high quality software products, enough to bring market and attention to Ethiopia</li>
</ul>

<p>For a project to be complete, participating members will have to be sure of the time they can give to the projects and also make sure they have the right skillset.</p>

<p>For developers that want to be involved but donâ€™t think they have a skillset that can deliver at the time needed can apply to the project and shadow the team members by filling the attached shadow developer form. Team members will be linked to a shadow member that will follow up and learn from them.</p>

<p>An example scenario is, If a team member is a project manager, and there is someone out there that wants to learn how to become a pm, s/he will shadow the pm and learn about the process<p>
